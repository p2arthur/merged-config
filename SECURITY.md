## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings.

### How to Report

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them via one of the following methods:

1. **GitHub Security Advisories**: Use the "Report a vulnerability" button in the [Security tab](https://github.com/mrcointreau/shared-config/security/advisories)
2. **GitHub Issues (Private)**: Open a [private security advisory](https://github.com/mrcointreau/shared-config/security/advisories/new)

### What to Include

When reporting a vulnerability, please include:

- **Description**: A clear description of the vulnerability
- **Impact**: The potential impact of the vulnerability
- **Steps to Reproduce**: Detailed steps to reproduce the issue
- **Affected Versions**: Which versions are affected
- **Possible Fix**: If you have suggestions for fixing the issue
- **References**: Any relevant CVEs, articles, or references

### What to Expect

- **Acknowledgment**: We will acknowledge receipt within 48 hours
- **Initial Assessment**: We will provide an initial assessment within 7 days
- **Resolution Timeline**: We aim to resolve critical issues within 30 days
- **Updates**: We will keep you informed of our progress
- **Credit**: We will credit you in the security advisory (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)

### Safe Harbor

We support safe harbor for security researchers who:

- Make a good faith effort to avoid privacy violations, destruction of data, and interruption or degradation of our services
- Only interact with accounts you own or with explicit permission of the account holder
- Do not exploit a security issue for purposes other than verification
- Report vulnerabilities promptly and provide reasonable time for resolution
